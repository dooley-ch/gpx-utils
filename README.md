# GpxUtils

![Splash](splash.png)

This utility was developed to help in the importation of GPX files into [Komoot](https://www.komoot.com).  It has two featuers:

* It splits a single file into multiple files, one for each tracking enter in the source file

* It merges all tracking entries in a file into a single one and stores it in a new merged file
